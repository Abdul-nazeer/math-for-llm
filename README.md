# Math for LLMs

This repo tracks my journey of learning the core mathematics needed to build and understand Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Roadmap

1. Linear Algebra
2. Probability & Statistics
3. Calculus & Optimization
4. Numerical Methods

Each topic will have:
- Notes
- Hand-solved exercises
- Python implementations

## Current Status

- [x] Started Linear Algebra (Day 1)
- [ ] Finished Day 1 of Linear Algebra
- [ ] Finish Linear Algebra module
- [ ] Start Probability & Statistics
- [ ] Start Calculus & Optimization
- [ ] Start Numerical Methods
